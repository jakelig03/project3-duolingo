# project3-duolingo

This code uses a duolingo database with 30k+ lines to sort hard or easy words based on the users native language. Our executable has 4 initial menu options, view words based on language, change the sort between quick and shell, view the languages in the database, and exit the program. If the user wants to sort and view words, they'll select 1 on the inital menu. This will bring them to another menu to select their native language. Then they'll select to see the sorted list in ascended or descending order. If the user wants to change the sorting algorithm, they'll select 2 on the inital menu. If the user wants to see the list of languages, they'll select 3 on the inital menu. If the user wants to close the program. they'll select 4 on the inital menu.
