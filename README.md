# project3-duolingo

This code uses a duolingo database with 30k+ lines to sort hard or easy words based on the users native language. We look at the native language, learning language, the word, the anount of questions involving that word, and the amount of questions that were answered correctly (roughly 150k total data points). Our executable has 4 options, view words based on language, change the sort between quick and shell, view the languages in the database, and exit the program.
