Developed an interactive console-based tool that analyzes a 30,000+ row Duolingo user accuracy dataset to rank vocabulary words as "easy" or "hard" based on the learner's native language. Users can:

- View word difficulty rankings for a selected language in ascending or descending order
- Toggle between sorting algorithms (Quick Sort and Shell Sort)
- Browse supported languages within the dataset
- Navigate paginated results in the terminal

The program also implements spatial efficiency and dynamic sorting logic to support comparative linguistic analysis, enabling educators and developers to better understand how native language impacts language learning accuracy.
